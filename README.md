##  Project Overview

This is my first portfolio project from Week 1 of the Elite Engineer Roadmap. The dashboard takes user input about daily habits and projects them across different time periods (weekly, monthly, yearly).

##  Features

- **Personal Information Tracking** - Basic user profile
- **Coffee Consumption Analysis** - Daily to yearly projections
- **Calorie Intake Calculator** - Nutritional tracking over time
- **Exercise Statistics** - Workout minutes converted to hours
- **Health Recommendations** - Based on WHO guidelines
- **Professional Terminal Interface** - Clean, organized output

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- User input handling with `input()`
- Type conversion (`int()`, `float()`)
- Mathematical calculations
- String formatting with f-strings

##  How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system
2. Download `health_dashboard.py`
3. Open terminal/command prompt
4. Navigate to the project folder
5. Run: `python health_dashboard.py`
6. Follow the prompts and enter your information
